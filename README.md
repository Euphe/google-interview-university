## The Daily Plan

Rehearse previous topic via anki.
Study a topic.
Implement with basic code. 
Write automated tests, basic asserts will do.
Sometimes write it on paper.
After studying a topic make anki cards for all parts that need memorizing:
    - For algorithms: summary (1 sentence), big-oh complexity
    - For data structures: summary, retrieval/deletion/insertion complexity
    - For paradigms: summary, examples of use

        - Test min-heap on large arrays of numbers, 10 million at least 
- ### Tries
    - Note there are different kinds of tries. Some have prefixes, some don't, and some use string instead of bits
        to track the path.
    - I read through code, but will not implement.

- ### Balanced search trees
    - Know least one type of balanced binary tree (and know how it's implemented):
    - "Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now passÃ©, and red-black trees seem to be more popular.
        A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations
        to move any accessed key to the root." - Skiena
    - Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a
        balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up
        and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code.
        - splay tree: insert, search, delete functions
        If you end up implementing red/black tree try just these:
        - search and insertion functions, skipping delete
    - I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets.
    - [ ] Self-balancing binary search tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree


    - [ ] **Splay trees**
        - In practice:
            Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors,
            data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory,
            networking, and file system code) etc.

                - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnPl_Y6EqMo

    - [ ] **2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)**
        - In practice:
            For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding redâ€“black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion
            operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in redâ€“black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an
            important tool for understanding the logic behind redâ€“black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce
            2-4 trees just before redâ€“black trees, even though **2-4 trees are not often used in practice**.

    - [ ] **B-Trees**
        - fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor)
        - In Practice:
            B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to
            its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary
            block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block
            (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address.
        - [ ] B-Tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree

    - [ ] **Red/black trees**
        - In practice:
            Redâ€“black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.
            Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,
            but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees;
            for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on redâ€“black trees, and
            the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses redâ€“black trees. In the version 8 of Java,
            the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor
            hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.

- ### N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees
    - note: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)
        - binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2

## Sorting

- [ ] Notes:
    - Implement sorts & know best case/worst case, average complexity of each:
        - no bubble sort - it's terrible - O(n^2), except when n <= 16

        - I wouldn't recommend sorting a linked list, but merge sort is doable.

- For heapsort, see Heap data structure above. Heap sort is great, but not stable.

    - [ ] Mergesort: O(n log n) average and worst case
    - [ ] Quicksort O(n log n) average case
    - Selection sort and insertion sort are both O(n^2) average and worst case
    - For heapsort, see Heap data structure above.

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes from Yegge:
    - There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - matrix
        - adjacency list
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none.

- ### Dynamic Programming
    - This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky.
    - I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.

    Scalability and System Design are very large topics with many topics and resources, since there is a lot to consider 
    when designing a software/hardware system that can scale. Expect to spend quite a bit of time on this.

- ### System Design, Scalability, Data Handling
    - Considerations from Yegge:
        - scalability
            - Distill large data sets to single values
            - Transform one data set to another
            - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
        - system design
            - features sets
            - interfaces
            - class hierarchies
            - designing a system under certain constraints
            - simplicity and robustness
            - tradeoffs

    - [ ] Practicing the system design process: Here are some ideas to try working through on paper, each with some documentation on how it was handled in the real world:
        - review: System Design from HiredInTech: http://www.hiredintech.com/system-design/
        - cheat sheet: https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university/blob/master/extras/cheat%20sheets/system-design.pdf
        - flow:
            1. Understand the problem and scope:
                - define the use cases, with interviewer's help
                - suggest additional features
                - remove items that interviewer deems out of scope
                - assume high availability is required, add as a use case
            2. Think about constraints:
                - ask how many requests per month
                - ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
                - estimate reads vs. writes percentage
                - keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
                - how much data written per second
                - total storage required over 5 years
                - how much data read per second
            3. Abstract design:
                - layers (service, data, caching)
                - infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
                - rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
                - consider bottlenecks and determine solutions
