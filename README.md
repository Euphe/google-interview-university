## The Daily Plan

Rehearse previous topic via anki.
Study a topic.
Implement with basic code. 
Write automated tests, basic asserts will do.
Sometimes write it on paper.
After studying a topic make anki cards for all parts that need memorizing:
    - For algorithms: summary (1 sentence), big-oh complexity
    - For data structures: summary, retrieval/deletion/insertion complexity
    - For paradigms: summary, examples of use

- ### Trees - Notes & Background
    - [x] http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Trees/toctree.html
    - [x] basic tree construction
    - [x] traversal
    - DFS (depth-first search)
        - notes:
            time complexity: O(n)
            space complexity:
                best: O(log n) - avg. height of tree
                worst: O(n)
        - [x] inorder (DFS: left, self, right)
        - [x] postorder (DFS: left, right, self)
        - [x] preorder (DFS: self, left, right)

_*Currently here*_
- ### Prefix tree
    - [ ] Prefix trees
    - [ ] Implement

- ### Trie
    - [ ] Tries
    - [ ] Implement

- ### Binary search trees: BSTs
	- [x] http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Trees/SearchTreeImplementation.html
    - [x] Implement:
        - [x] insert    // insert value into tree
        - [x] get_node_count // get count of values stored
        - [x] print_values // prints the values in the tree, from min to max
        - [x] delete_tree
        - [x] is_in_tree // returns true if given value exists in the tree
        - [x] delete_value
        - [x] get_successor // returns next-highest value in tree after given value


- ### Heap / Priority Queue / Binary Heap
    - visualized as a tree, but is usually linear in storage (array, linked list)
    - [x] http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Trees/BinaryHeapImplementation.html
    - [x] Implement a min-heap:
        - [x] MinHeap() creates a new, empty, binary heap.
		- [x] put(k) adds a new item to the heap.
		- [x] find_min() returns the item with the minimum key value, leaving item in the heap.
		- [x] del_min() returns the item with the minimum key value, removing the item from the heap.
		- [x] is_empty() returns true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.
		- [x] __len__() returns the number of items in the heap.
		- [x] _from_list(list) builds a new heap from a list of keys.
        - [x] heap_sort() - take an unsorted array and turn it into a sorted array in-place using a min heap - not implement, just read

- ### Balanced search trees
    - Know least one type of balanced binary tree (and know how it's implemented):
    - [x] Red/black trees - just read on them

## Sorting

    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability
    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517793/stability-in-sorting-algorithms
    
- For heapsort, see Heap data structure above. Heap sort is great, but not stable.

	- [x] Bubble sort - no need to implement
	- [x] Selection sort - no need to implement
	- [x] Insertion sort - no need to implement
	- [x] Merge sort - implement
	- [x] Quick sort - implement


## Graphs
Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.
- Notes from Yegge:
    - There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - matrix
        - adjacency list
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none.


- [x] Graphs (review and more):
    - [x] http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Graphs/toctree.html
    - [x] https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs

    - [X] http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Graphs/PrimsSpanningTreeAlgorithm.html

- I'll implement:
    - [x] DFS with adjacency list (recursive)
    - [x] http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Graphs/ImplementingKnightsTour.html - I am pretty sure code from here is wrong
    - [x] http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Graphs/GeneralDepthFirstSearch.html

    - [x] BFS with adjacency list
        - [x] http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/Graphs/ImplementingBreadthFirstSearch.html

## Even More Knowledge
- ### Recursion
    - how is tail recursion better than not?
        - [x] https://www.quora.com/What-is-tail-recursion-Why-is-it-so-bad
 
- ### Dynamic Programming
    - This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky.
    - I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.

    Scalability and System Design are very large topics with many topics and resources, since there is a lot to consider 
    when designing a software/hardware system that can scale. Expect to spend quite a bit of time on this.

- ### System Design, Scalability, Data Handling
    - Considerations from Yegge:
        - scalability
            - Distill large data sets to single values
            - Transform one data set to another
            - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
        - system design
            - features sets
            - interfaces
            - class hierarchies
            - designing a system under certain constraints
            - simplicity and robustness
            - tradeoffs
            - performance analysis and optimization

    - [ ] Practicing the system design process: Here are some ideas to try working through on paper, each with some documentation on how it was handled in the real world:
        - review: System Design from HiredInTech: http://www.hiredintech.com/system-design/
        - cheat sheet: https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university/blob/master/extras/cheat%20sheets/system-design.pdf
        - flow:
            1. Understand the problem and scope:
                - define the use cases, with interviewer's help
                - suggest additional features
                - remove items that interviewer deems out of scope
                - assume high availability is required, add as a use case
            2. Think about constraints:
                - ask how many requests per month
                - ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
                - estimate reads vs. writes percentage
                - keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
                - how much data written per second
                - total storage required over 5 years
                - how much data read per second
            3. Abstract design:
                - layers (service, data, caching)
                - infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
                - rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
                - consider bottlenecks and determine solutions
